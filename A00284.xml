            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A Magiſtrate is a choſen perſon and that of God that he ſhold, defend the lawes, and peace, and repreſſe and hold downe vices, and all thinges that ar euel, with poniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and his ſword.

Th for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal cauſe is, the ordre that he apoincteth by the prouidence of God in matters that apperatine vnto men, or in wordly matters. The materiall cauſe, is a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a perſon, for who ſoeuer is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to be a Magiſtrate, he is one choſen owt of Men.

It belongeth onely vnto Chriſt to deale owte vnto his members ſpirituall
<pb facs="tcp:1492:16"/>motions, the litghtening of the mind, and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lyfte. In deed, Kinges and Magiſtrates may be <hi>called the heddes of the people, becauſe the ciuill gouernement is exerciſed by them,</hi> and we may loke to haue from them good lawes, and ciuill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But in the chirch it is not entreated of the ciuill lyffe, but of the ſpirituall and euerlaſting, which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not loke for of any, but only of God, neither is there any mortall man that can quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the membres of the chirch. I do iudge that the Kinges and Magiſtrates that ar godly ought to be ſet or counted in the chirch in the formeſt or higheſt place, or dignitie, and that hit belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to there office, if that Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be euell han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled, to correct the defaultes, for they beare the ſword for that ende, that they may defend the honor of God, but they cannot be the heddes of the chirches. Paul to the Romaines and Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians (where he maketh co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paracions betwene the members of the chirch) maketh ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be eyes, ſome to be noſthrilles, eares, hand and feete: but he vouchſaueth not to deck any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the dignitie of the hedde. And yet the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame Paul writing to the Epheſ. ſaieth of Chriſt, that God gaue him, to be hedde of the body of the chirch. Therefore let the Papiſtes, ſhewe, where hit is ſaied in holy ſcripture, that there was another hedde giuen vnto the chirch beſide Chriſt. If they can do that lett them haue the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie: but I am ſure they ar neuer hable to do hit.

               <p>FIrſt for aſmuch, as I entend to write of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges indifferent, as they ar named, and ſome ar ſo in deede, it is beſt to tell what this word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different meaneth. Indifferent is called in the Greke <hi>Adiaphoron,</hi> and in Latine <hi>Indifferens,</hi> and in Duytch <hi>eine mittelding.</hi> And hit ſignifieth a thing, wherof is made no matter, whether a man kepe hit or do not kepe hit, or whether hit be hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led after this manner, or that manner. Therear in the Chirch certaine thinges which ar indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and that there is ſuch in the chirch of God, it may eaſely be proued by Paul, as in the former to the Corinthians the 7.8.10 and 14. chapiters, alſo to the Romanes in the. 14. chapiter may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere. Of which ſort ar: to liue maried, or vn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſo that hit be don in Chaſtitie, to eate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes or to abſtaine therfro, to kepe daies, or not to kepe daies, withowte ſuperſtition, to take wagis of them, to whome a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preacheth to, or to take none at all, to vſe a preſcribed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of teaching in the Temple, to heare or to ſinge.</p>
               <p>If any man wold call back againe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the garmentes or veſtementes of Ethniſh, or Popiſh ſacrifices, and bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches after the vſe of them were once put downe, he ſhold do contrary to that which is ſemely and comenly.</p>
               <p>It lieth not in the power of any man, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any worſhippings of God, withowte the commaundement of God.</p>
               <p>Althinges that ar indifferent, ar ſo far indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb facs="tcp:1492:18"/>as they ſerue for the glorie of God, and the profit of the Chirch. But if they paſſe beyond thoſe bondes, they ar not indifferent: but ar, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlines, and abhominations, and by all meanes, of all men to be eſchewed.</p>
               <p>Whatſoeuer Antechriſt doth, theſame he doth for the Diuelles ſake, whoſe vicar he is, and of whome he is ſtirred vp to play his part: And whatſoeuer vnchriſtian Princes do in Religion, they do hit for Antechriſtis ſake, and his ſeates ſake, as the letters of the Pope, vnto the Biſhops, and the Biſhops letters ſent to Popiſhe Princes, &amp; to diuers chirches beare witnes. And further, whatſoeuer the Popiſhe Princes, and vnchriſtian courtes do in theſe matters, and chaunges, they do hit for the pleaſure &amp; fauor of the ſupreame gouernors. Alſo whatſoeuer thold diuines do in theſe matters, they do hit to gratifie the Court, and the inferior Princes. At the laſt, whatſoeuer the younger diuines do, either to ſet forth or not to hindre this miſchieff of indifferent matters, they do hit for the pleaſure of there old Maſters. Wherfore from the firſt to the laſt, they ſerue all Antechriſt, and the Diuell, and committ whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with the greate whore, and drinck of her cup, as hit is prophicied in th'apocalips (not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owt a cauſe) of the laſt times.</p>
               <p>We nede not to care for that which ſome do ofte time rehers, that the chirch hath allwaies ben in ſomme bondage, for although hit hath ben allwaies in politick bondage, yet ſhe neuer did tempre her ſelf, or faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her to the Religion of vngodly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neither wold God, that ſhe ſhold be ſubdued vnto any ſpiritual bondage, But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:1492:18"/>that ſhe ſhold ſtedfaſtly defend her liberty, and not to be made the bond woman of men, ſeing that ſhe is redemed with the precious blood of Chriſte: Wherfore ſeing that theſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ar thruſt vppon the chirch whether ſhe will or no, and that of the greateſt, and moſt openly knowen ennemies of Chriſt (that is of the Pope and both of learned and lay Papiſtes) it is not lawfull by any meanes to receaue them, neither ar they thinges indifferent, but the wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of Antechriſt and Antiochus.</p>
               <p>Oure indifferentiaries that ar of ſtowter ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maches, would not beſo nice, and of a ſtraight conſcience, that they dare not defie the gold of the golden calf but that they wold deſier ſome fat part of hit to be giuen vnto them.</p>
               <p>Thoſe things that haue ben offered in Idol ſeruice, or ſerued Idolatry, they ar Idolatrous, &amp; can not ſerue God, and he wold that ſuch ſhold be caſt awaye.</p>
               <p>The braſen ſerpent was ordeined of GOD,<note place="margin">VVhatthen to ſurpleſſes.</note> and that by Moſes the ſeruant of GOD, and his greate Prophet, but after his ſerued Idolatry, it was no more God his ſerpent, or Moſes ſerpent, but the ſerpent of Idolaters, and the Diuelles ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and Ezechias is praiſed (who brak hit) for that deede.</p>
               <p>Euen as we defie and abhorre, the garments or cote of a theeffe, of a Murtherer of A Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or of a common whore, though the garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t hit ſelf be innocent and hath done no harme, neither will any honeſt man do ſo much as gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly touch hit: So all they that ar godly in dede, defie ſuch Popiſh trifles with all there hartes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
<pb facs="tcp:1492:19"/>that they haue ſerued in the Popedome, &amp; ben occupied with abuſes and wickednes: and haue ſerued the ſacrificers that were polluted and defiled with idolatry.</p>
               <p>Auſtin ſayth, that faith is in great icoperdy, when it is amongeſt a great nomber of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>This is moſt trew in all thinges, that the man that is occupied about many thinges doth not ſufficientlie take hede to euerye one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and therefore it is trulie ſaid:</p>

               </q>
               <p>SO the people, being charged to kepe all the commaundementes of god and his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and more ſtraitlie commaunded to kepe mo ordinances of men then goddis commaundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>If that the indifferentiaries go forward to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the chirch of Chriſt as they haue begon, and will ſet in the place of godlye and lerned prechers: whom they haue put away fooles and courtlie flatterers, ſhortly we ſhall haue no god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye preachers at all.</p>
               <p>Were there is a heauie bondage in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and in the worſhipping of God, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the glad libertie of Chriſt be.</p>

               <p>What other thing goeth the deuell about, with all his thowſand craftes and ſubtelties, but to confirme the wicked in theyr wickednes, and to geue them occaſion to triumph ouer the trew chirch, and ouer Chriſte him ſelf, and to blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the holie name of the lord, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie part to diſcourage and make ſand the holie goſte in godlie men, and to make them faynt in godlines, &amp; at length, alſo to doubt of the whole doctrine of the trew chirch, what thinge can more make afrayd, and make faynte ſouldiers, then to ſe theyr captaynes quake and tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble for feare? Ceſar ſayde that he had leiuer fyghte with an hoſte of Lions, that had a hart for theyr Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, then with an hoſt of hartes whoſe Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne were a Lion.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhould ſpeake thus to another, and ſay thou haſt ſtolen from me an hundred crownes, I require of the that thow reſtore me them againe quietlie, leſt I be compelled to vſe gainſt the ſome more violent remedies: and yf this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accuſed of thefte, ſhould firſt paie him x,

I ſuppoſe ſo in dede: Euen ſo, when we ar accuſed of the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, and marring of the whole Religion of Chriſt, and ar commanded to reſtore it to the old eſtate againe and we begin to reſtore it in ſuch thinges as ſeme moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monlie before mens eies (as ar out ward rites and ceremonies) do not we ſeme to condemne our owne ſelues: may not we be thought to deny our owne religion? how ſoeuer bewteous dreames we feyne in our thoughtes.</p>
               <p>It was an indifferent thinge, for Chriſt to waſh his handes, yea it had a ciuill and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe, for it is good manners and ciuilitie to come to the table rather with waſhed handes then with foule handes, beſides that, after the doctrine of the phiſitiones of Salerne, it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for the eies, to waſhe the handes oft, yet not withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all theſe, Chriſt woulde not waſhe his handes with the Phariſes, becauſe he would ouerthrow their traditiones, and would not ſeme by his waſhing to confirme and alow their traditiones.</p>
               <p>It is not the poinct of a good chriſtian, and as litle the office of a good diuine, to beleue that, by angring of God and by ſwaging of mannes wrath, that we ſhall come to any perfect peace. For tyrantes ar only as it were certaine roddes
<pb facs="tcp:1492:20"/>in goddes hande, as God witneſſeth him ſelfe, in Eſay the Prophit, wherefore the hand ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pacified and ſwaged from wrath, then the rod but if it were poſſible to pacific &amp; pleaſe the rod, that it ſhoulde not beate vs againſt the will of the hand: then were it to be feared that the hande ſhoulde caſt the rod away and take a Betell or a Maule and breake vs all as ſmall as Powlder.</p>
               <p>Luther did truly name wicked wyſdome to be the feire hore of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtelles had leyuer that their ſcoles ſhould be broken vp then in any part to geue place vnto the vngodlie, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme or allowe their traditiones.</p>

               <p>It belongeth not to <hi>any one man, neyther to a fevv men to ordeyne ſuch ceremonies</hi> or rites as ar aboue named, (to wete) ſuch as neither promote the glory of God, nor profit his chirche, but haue <hi>only a vayne shevv of holynes or ſemelynes,</hi> and do no other good, and that <hi>vvithout the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the chirch or congregation,</hi> much leſſe ought any mà to make ſuch, quite contrary to the mynd and will of the Chirch, or of the aſſembly of gods people.

               <p>As they that put on the Crowne of thorne vpon Chriſtes head to mock him, gaue him no honor, (although they ſemed to make him a Kynge) but greued him very ſore and put him to muche payne.

                  <p>FYrſt of all I affirme that in the Chirch of Chriſt, there are ſome thinges to be obſerued continually, ſome thinges are indifferent and free: other ſome thinges are by no meanes tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

                  <p>I call thoſe thynges ffree whatſoeuer they be that ſerue profitablye and commodiouſlye to the miniſterye of the worde and Sacramentes, ſo they haue theyr originall ground in the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, haue no commaundement againſt them, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Theſe thynges that are vttarly to be remoued from the church, are of two ſortes, ſome haue ſo manifeſt impietie annexed to them, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Now what great incommodities and hurt haue crept into the church by meanes of euerye one of theſe, and yet maye more crepe in, except they be remoued I cannot at this preſent parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularlye declare.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes appoyncted ouar to the Preiſtes, and others wythin orders, who ſhould put them on when they occupied them ſelues about holie thynges, whych Pope Steuen the fyrſt dyd firſt apoinct ſhould be done, amongſt oure Chirch men: for he ſayth, that in the begynning whan religion begane to ſpring, Preiſtes were wont to put no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more vppon them, when they went to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſeruice, ſtanding raither to decke them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in wardlye wyth verteus of the mind, and to caſt awaye affections and vices of the bodye, then to take on them new attire. Now thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I, and gather. Yf they changed not theyr gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or apparell whan they went to gods ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce then they vſed none for theim that were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Myniſterie of the goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Paule and Barnabas were contented wyth laying on handes, Faſting and prayer, Paul dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye
<pb facs="tcp:1492:26"/>preſcribing to Timothie, and Titus all the offices of A Biſhop, makith no mention of peculiar garmentes and other ceremonies. and that the vſe of apparell did not by and by goe ouer all Churchis, it is euident enough by the decre of Celeſtine the fyrſt Byſhop of Rome: whoſe wordes are theſe againſt ſuch peculiar veſture of Biſhopes. We are to be diſcerned (ſaith he) from the common people or other, in doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne not apparell, in conuerſation not in habit, in puritie of mind not in attire: For yf we begine to geue our ſelues to nouelties, wee ſhall contemne and caſt awaye the order that the Fathers haue deliuered, and lefte vs and ſhall make a place for ſuperfluous ſuperſticions: wee muſt not therfore drawe the ſimple mindes of the faithfull to ſuch thinges, for they muſt rayther be inſtructed, then begiled, and mocked, neither muſt we deceiue theire bodylie eyes, but poure in preceptes into theire mindes. Thus far he, yet can we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, but as men bend, and inclyne to ſuperſticion of them ſelues: ſo ſome kynde of garmentes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though verye ſimple and plaine had crepte into many Churchis before this mans dayes. For Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter no doubt gaue the occaſion. But Carolus (called the great) finiſhed the matter as ſtories beare wittnes. Now it is made manifeſt that the vſe of peculiar apparell in the church or eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall perſones, is a mere deuiſe and inuention of men, and therfore to be reiected for this cauſe if there were no more.</p>
                  <p>They which wolde kepe thuſe of this appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in the Church as a thinge inſtituted of God, refer the ſame to Aarons preyſthoode, but they
<pb facs="tcp:1492:26"/>litle for ſee what they ſay. For we knowe by the ſcriptures, that Chriſt is not a Prieſt after the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Aaron, but of Melchiſedech, &amp; that Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s priſthood was extinguiſhed, and toke ende in Chriſte with all the parts therof, among the which we recken alſo the apparell. Therfore Chriſt the veric wiſdome of the father vſed no new, or peculiar kynd of apparell in holie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterye, neyther appoincted any other to be vſed. For that the figuratiue prieſthod as a ſhadowe was perfited, and ended in Chriſt the one and onelye Prieſt. All they therfore that call agayne Aarons apparell into the Chirch, diſhonor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes prieſthod, as though beynge the lyght it ſelf, he nedid ſhadowes, neither wyll that excuſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, to ſay that all Aarons prieſthod is not called into vſe agayne, but ſome parte therof onelye: but he that receyuith a parte, doeth not reiect the wholle. But all Aarons prieſthode being a figure and ſhadowe is no doubt to be reiected, for that it is abrogated, and as many as do reſtore againe thoſe thynges that the auctorytie of gods worde hathe deſtroyed and abrogated, are tranſgreſſers of gods lawe. Paule therfore well teachith, that the bond mayde is to be caſt forth &amp; hir Sonne, ſingnifiyng that all the bondage of the lawe is to be reiected, after the lyght of the goſpell is ſpronge forth and riſen, and he wyllith vs not to ſuffer our ſelues to be remoued from our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye in Chriſt, now it is to playne that the doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and commaandementes of whatſoeuer kynd of apparell peculiar, in gods myniſterye is a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of gods lawes: For becauſe Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hode is called in to vſe agayne.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:1492:27"/>
                  <p>If any man by occaſion of the firſt argument deny that the garmentes are a portion of Aarons prieſthoode, and ſay that they were by a certaine libertye brought in of the Byſhopes of Rome, to adorne and ſet forth prieſtlye ordar, yet ſaith he not enough why they may be law fully retained, we knowe that the Pope of Rome is very Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſte him ſelfe, wherfore his prieſthode alſo is Antichriſtian, wherby Chriſtes prieſthod who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie is foyled and vtterlie troden vndar fote. But foraſmuch as the chiefeſt part of the prieſthod of the Pope conſiſtith in Ceremonies, Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhauing, Miters, and garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, for with owt theſe they accoumpt no man Byſhoppe, and they coumpthym Byſhop whatſoeuar he be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe, that is ſet oute with theſe thinges, yt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowith that yf we condemne the popiſh prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hod, for that it is Antchriſtian, wee ought to auoid all the partes and notes therof alſo.
